API key check for the fraud service.

Only requests that carry the correct secret key in the 'X-API-Key' header are
allowed through. The expected key is read from the FRAUD_API_KEY environment
variable, which is loaded from a local .env file that is NOT committed to git.

This is the "only authorized eyes may use the system" requirement, kept
deliberately simple - a header check, not an enterprise identity system.
